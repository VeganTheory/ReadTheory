# Animal Testing Doesn't Work Masterpost

#### In short: Animal Testing simply does not hold up to scientific rigor that is required for actual science.

[Systematic Reviews of Animal Models: Methodology versus Epistemology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558708/). publish date 2013.

tl;dr - systemic review compared animal testing to homeopathy, furthermore states that it's holding back medical science.

> Our position, and apparently the position of scientists calling for standardization of animal protocols and Systemic Reviews, that **animal models do not currently qualify as predictive modalities for human response to drugs and disease is supported by experts in various fields of science.**

furthermore,

> The problem is that animal models are not predictive modalities, not that animal models fail to reveal side effects. 

> Put succinctly, humans and animals are complex systems with different evolutionary trajectories.

> SR[Systemic Review]s are only useful if there is scientific validity to the assumptions or axioms underlying the research. There is no reason to conduct SRs of homeopathy nor does complexity theory and evolutionary biology offer any reason to expect SRs of animal models to be productive. Regardless of how the problem is approached, animal and humans will always be differently complex.

> Nevertheless it is vital to do so in order for science in general, and medical science in particular, to advance.


[Systematic Reviews of Animal Experiments Demonstrate Poor Contributions Toward Human Healthcare](https://doi.org/10.2174/157488708784223844). [publish date 2008](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.2174/157488708784223844)

tl;dr - a systemic review of systemic reviews found that animal experimentation is not scentifically beneficial. How can it be, when it doesn't even work if we use chimps, the most similar species to us?

> **When evaluated overall, these 27 systematic reviews clearly do 
not  support  the  widely  held  assumptions  of  animal  ethics  commit-tees and the opinions of advocates that animal experiments are gen-erally beneficial in the development of human therapeutic interven-tions,  and  the  assessment  of  human  toxicity.  On  the  contrary,  they  frequently  demonstrate  that  animal  experiments  are  of  low  utility  for these purposes.** This results both from limitations of the animal models  themselves,  and  also  from  the  poor  methodological  quality  and statistical design of many animal experiments. 

> Chimpanzees  are  our  closest  living  relatives,  and  consequently  might be expected to have the greatest likelihood among laboratory species of accurately predicting human outcomes during preclinical research.  However,  despite  great  similarity  between  the  structural  regions  of  chimpanzee  and  human  DNA,  important  differences  between  the  regulatory  regions  exert  an  “avalanche”  effect upon  large  numbers  of  structural  genes  [54].  Despite  nucleotide  differ-ence  between  chimpanzees  and  humans  of  only  1-2%,  the  results  are differences of around 80% in protein  expression [55], resulting in  marked  phenotypic  differences  between  the  species.  These  dif-ferences manifest in  altered  susceptibility  to,  etiology and progres-
sion  of  diseases;  differing  absorption,  tissue  distribution,  metabo-lism,  and  excretion  of  chemotherapeutic  agents;  and  differences  in  the  toxicity  and  efficacy  of  pharmaceuticals  [22,  54].  Such  effects  appear  to  be  responsible  for  the  demonstrated  inability  of  most  chimpanzee research to contribute substantially to the development of methods efficacious in combating human diseases [22].  <br/> Other  laboratory  animal  species  are  even  less  similar  to  hu-mans,  both  genetically  and  phenotypically,  and  are  therefore  less  likely  to  accurately  model  the  progression  of  human  diseases,  or  human responses to putative chemotherapeutic agents or toxins. 

> The  historical  and  contemporary  paradigm  that  animal  models  are  generally  reasonably  predictive  of  human  outcomes  provides  the  basis  for  their  widespread  use  in  toxicity  testing,  and  in  bio-medical  research  aimed  at  developing  cures  for  human  diseases.  However, their use persists for historical and cultural reasons, rather than because they have been demonstrated to be scientifically valid. 

> Non-animal models are generally required to pass formal scien-
tific  validation  prior  to  regulatory  acceptance.  In  contrast,  animal  models  are  simply  assumed  to  be  predictive  of  human  outcomes.  
However,  these  27  systematic  reviews  of  the  human  utility  of  ani-mal  experiments  demonstrate  the  invalidity  of  such  assumptions,  even for animal models in use for long periods. 


Summary: 
Animals are not unfeeling toys for us to torture, and experimentation is functionally indistinguishable from medical torture to the victim. It is also completely scientifically unnecessary. It is torture for the sake of psuedoscience.
