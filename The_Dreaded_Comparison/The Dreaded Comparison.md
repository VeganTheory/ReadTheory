Chapter 1:  An Historical Understanding

Comparing specieism with racism? At first glance, many people might feel that it is insulting to compare the suffering of non-human animals to that of humans. In fact, in our society, comparison to an animal has come to be a slur.

Why is it an insult for anyone to be compared to an animal? In many culutres, such a comparison was an honor. In Native American cultures, for example, individuals adopted the names of admired animals, and had spirit guides - in animal form - who served both as teachers and escorts into the realm of the spirit world. Names such as sitting Bull, Running Deer, and Hawkeye are familiar to us, expressive of the admiration Native Americans had for the animals with whom they shared both the earth and the afterlife. Native Americans, Ancient Egyptians, some African tribes, and many other ancient and aboriginal cultures the world over have worshipped various animals as gods or messengers to god. So how is that we find ourselves in a time when comparison to a non-human animal has ceased to be an honor and is instead hurled as an insult?

By the time the New World was "discovered" and colonization began, Europeans had "subdued" most of the land which they had for centuries inhabitated [1] Europen's wilderness were long gone, replaced with a very "managed" countryside comprised of "English gardens" rolling hills where mighty forests had long ago stood, and relatively few stands of woods, often maintained as hunting grounds.

Understandably, it came as quite a shock to the British colonists' psyches when they encountered the unbridled and deeply forested North American wilderness. The white Puritan colonists measured "progress" and "civilization" in terms of (among other things) how far a people could distanc themselves from Nature. "Countless diaries, addresses and memorials of the frontier period" writes historian Roderick Nash, attest to this in their representations of "the wilderness as an 'enemy' which had to 'conquered', 'subdued', and 'vanquished' by a 'pioneer army'."[2] To the average colonist, explains Nash,

"wilderness...aquired significance as a dark and sinister symbol. [The pioneers] shared the long Western tradition of imagining wild country as a moral vacuum, a cursed and chaotic wasteland. As a consequence, fortiersmen acutely sensed that they battled wild country not only for personal survival but in the name of nation, race and God. Civilizing the New World meant enlightening darkness, ordering chaos, and changing evil into good [3]"

Holding these beliefs, white Christians were convinced that it was virtually a moral obligation to conquer any people who were still living in harmony with the devil-ridden, moral wasteland of nature - as "savages," in their opinion. Paying no regard to the level of cultural sophistication or even to the general happiness of the people living within their native societies, the conquerors merely saw "heathens" while proceeding to destroy entire cultures, along with the ancient ecosystems which had long supported them.

In 1688, the idea of the "noble savage" was introduced by English playwright and novelist Aphra Behn in Oroonko. The noble savage hated his fellow slaves because they were:
